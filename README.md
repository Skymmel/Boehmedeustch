> This is one of the dialects of Sudetenland.

Bohemian German (Böhmedeutsch) was a historical German dialect spoken by German-speaking inhabitants of the Bohemian/Czech lands, particularly in border regions. After World War II, due to the expulsion of Sudeten Germans between 1945 and 1946, the number of speakers declined drastically. Without natural transmission between generations and due to demographic and language policy changes, the dialect gradually disappeared. Today, only isolated records and memories of this linguistic variant remain.
